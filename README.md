# MusicProgramming
A repo to hold collaborative music programming with the [Euterpea](http://euterpea.com/) library. Also see the [Haskell School of Music Book](http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/HSoM.pdf). We also have a hard copy in the FPC library. Ask the president to check it out.
